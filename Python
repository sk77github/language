ez_setup.py    python-setuptools  easy_install   pip  egg文件 wheel（https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/projects）

easy_install was released in 2004, as part of setuptools. 
It was notable at the time for installing packages from PyPI using requirement specifiers, and automatically installing dependencies.

pip came later in 2008, as alternative to easy_install, although still largely built on top of setuptools components. 
It was notable at the time for not installing packages as Eggs or from Eggs (but rather simply as ‘flat’ packages from sdists), 
and introducing the idea of Requirements Files, which gave users the power to easily replicate environments.



操作系统源安装：pip setuptools wheel

pip:
To use a package from this index either "pip install package" (get pip)
or download, unpack and "python setup.py install" it.
To install the latest version of “SomeProject”:
pip install 'SomeProject'
To install a specific version:
pip install 'SomeProject==1.4'
To install greater than or equal to one version and less than another:
pip install 'SomeProject>=1,<2'
To install a version that’s “compatible” with a certain version: [4]
pip install 'SomeProject~=1.4.2'
In this case, this means to install any version “==1.4.*” version that’s also “>=1.4.2”.

Installing with get-pip.py
To install pip, securely download get-pip.py（https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py）
Then run the following:
python get-pip.py

get-pip.py will also intall setuptools （Beginning with pip v1.5.1, get-pip.py stopped requiring setuptools to be installed first.
） and wheel, if they're not already. 
setuptools is required to install source distributions.
Both are required to be able to build a Wheel Cache (which improves installation speed),
although neither are required to install pre-built wheels.
//end pip
