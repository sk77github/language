Python模块常用的几种安装方式（http://blog.163.com/yang_jianli/blog/static/161990006201162152724339/）

ez_setup.py
The recommended way to bootstrap setuptools on any system is to download ez_setup.py and run it using the target Python environment
Most Linux distributions come with wget.
Download ez_setup.py and run it using the target Python version. The script will download the appropriate version and install it for you:
> wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python
(
Note that on some older systems (noted on Debian 6 and CentOS 5 installations),wget may refuse to download ez_setup.py
> wget --no-check-certificate https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py
> python ez_setup.py --insecure
)
只需要一个大约 8K 作为的脚本ez_setup.py，就能自动为用户安装包括 setuptools 自身在内的许多 Python 包。 
使用这种方式，用户只需要下载 ez_setup。py 并运行，就可以自动下载和安装适合用户当前 Python 版本的适当的
setuptools egg 文件。此外，这段脚本还会将可执行的 easy_install 脚本安装到用户所有的操作系统 Python 可执行脚本正常应该安装的位置

easy_install
easy_install was released in 2004, as part of setuptools. 
It was notable at the time for installing packages from PyPI using requirement specifiers, and automatically installing dependencies.

pip
pip came later in 2008, as alternative to easy_install, although still largely built on top of setuptools components. 
It was notable at the time for not installing packages as Eggs or from Eggs (but rather simply as ‘flat’ packages from sdists), 
and introducing the idea of Requirements Files, which gave users the power to easily replicate environments.



操作系统源安装：pip setuptools wheel
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/install_requirements_linux/#installing-pip-setuptools-wheel-with-linux-package-managers
CentOS and RHEL don’t offer pip or wheel in their core repositories, although setuptools is installed by default.
To install pip and wheel for the system Python, there are two options:

Enable the EPEL repository using these instructions. On EPEL 6 and EPEL7, you can install pip like so:
sudo yum install python-pip
On EPEL 7 (but not EPEL 6), you can install wheel like so:
sudo yum install python-wheel
Since EPEL only offers extra, non-conflicting packages, EPEL does not offer setuptools, since it’s in the core repository.

Enable the PyPA Copr Repo using these instructions [1]. You can install pip and wheel like so:
sudo yum install python-pip python-wheel
To additionally upgrade setuptools, run:
sudo yum upgrade python-setuptools



pip:
pip has a number of subcommands: “search”, “install”, “uninstall”, “freeze”, "list",etc

To use a package from this index either "pip install package" (get pip)
or download, unpack and "python setup.py install" it.
To install the latest version of “SomeProject”:
pip install 'SomeProject'
To install a specific version:
pip install 'SomeProject==1.4'
To install greater than or equal to one version and less than another:
pip install 'SomeProject>=1,<2'
To install a version that’s “compatible” with a certain version: [4]
pip install 'SomeProject~=1.4.2'
In this case, this means to install any version “==1.4.*” version that’s also “>=1.4.2”.

Installing with get-pip.py
To install pip, securely download get-pip.py（https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py）
Then run the following:
python get-pip.py

get-pip.py will also intall setuptools （Beginning with pip v1.5.1, get-pip.py stopped requiring setuptools to be installed first.
） and wheel, if they're not already. 
setuptools is required to install source distributions.
Both are required to be able to build a Wheel Cache (which improves installation speed),
although neither are required to install pre-built wheels.
//end pip
