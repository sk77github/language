the different:

in python,when you send a list or dict's name,it's send a pointer to that object
in php, when you send a array's name,it's send the array's value


the same:
they both have the same features __call(in php),__call__(in python),it's mean when you call a function that the class didn't have,the
language will auto call the function __call(or __call__),which you define it in the class
