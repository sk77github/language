Q:in python2.7,UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa5 in position 0: invalid start byte:?

A:
Your string has a non ascii character encoded in it.

Not being able to decode with utf-8 may happen if you've needed to use other encodings in your code. For example:

>>> 'my weird character \x96'.decode('utf-8')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Python27\lib\encodings\utf_8.py", line 16, in decode
    return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x96 in position 19: invalid start byte
In this case, the encoding is windows-1252 so you have to do:

>>> 'my weird character \x96'.decode('windows-1252')
u'my weird character \u2013'
Now that you have unicode, you can safely encode into utf-8.
