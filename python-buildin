id(object)
Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.
Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.
CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.

All of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not. 
Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default. They all compare unequal (except with themselves), 
and their hash value is derived from their id().

 Set Types — set, frozenset
 集合类型  —— 可变集合，不可变集合

A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, 
removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, 
and symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in dict, list, and tuple classes, and the collections module.)
